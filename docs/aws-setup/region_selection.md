# AWS Region Selection Guide

AWS root and IAM users are global, but resources (S3, EC2, Lambda, etc.) are created in specific regions.

## Recommended Regions for Colombia
- **us-east-1 (N. Virginia, USA):** Closest, most popular, best supported, and often the default.
- **us-east-2 (Ohio, USA):** Good alternative.
- **us-west-2 (Oregon, USA):** Another option.

**Recommendation:**
Choose `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) unless you have a specific reason to use another region. Itâ€™s closest to Colombia, has the most services, and is often the cheapest.

You can always change the region for each service or project as needed.
