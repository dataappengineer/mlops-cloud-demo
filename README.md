# MLOps Cloud Demo

This project demonstrates a complete MLOps pipeline in a cloud environment. It is organized into the following main components:

- **mlops-pipeline/**: Contains code and configuration for the machine learning pipeline, including data processing, model training, and deployment scripts.
- **infrastructure/**: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scripts and configuration for provisioning cloud resources (e.g., using Terraform, CloudFormation, or ARM templates).
- **monitoring/**: Tools and scripts for monitoring deployed models and infrastructure, including logging, alerting, and performance dashboards.
- **frontend/**: (Optional) Web-based UI for interacting with the pipeline, visualizing results, or managing deployments.
- **docs/**: Documentation, architecture diagrams, and usage guides for the project.

## Getting Started

1. Review the documentation in the `docs/` folder for setup and usage instructions.
2. Explore each component folder for specific details and code.
3. Customize the pipeline and infrastructure as needed for your use case.

## Project Goals

- Automate the end-to-end ML workflow from data ingestion to model deployment.
- Enable reproducible and scalable ML operations in the cloud.
- Provide monitoring and observability for deployed models.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for managing the pipeline.
